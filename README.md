Classification Service
===============
Provides an end-point that performs classifications via REST API calls.

Overview
--------
  A REST API that performs classification using the designated network structure and weights.
  
**Start the service (development only):**
```
    python ./classificationservice.py
```

I've tested running dicebox with uwsgi, and proxied through nginx.  Nginx configurations can be found within ./nginx of this repository.
```
uwsgi --http-socket 127.0.0.1:5000 --manage-script-name --mount /=classificationservice.py --plugin python,http --enable-threads --callable app â€”master
```

### Production Deployment

**Docker Container**

The recommended way to run the service is by using the official provided docker container.
The container should be deployed to a Docker Swarm as a service.

**Example**
```
docker service create \
--detach=false \
--publish 8003:80 \
--replicas 0  \
--log-driver json-file \
--name classificationservice shapeandshare/dicebox.classificationservice
```

How to apply rolling updates of the service within the swarm:
```
docker service update --image shapeandshare/dicebox.classificationservice:latest classificationservice
```

In the examples above the Docker Swarm was deployed to AWS and had the Cloudstor:aws plugin enabled and active.
The classification service containers will store and read data from the shared storage.

**Global shared Cloudstor volumes mounted by all tasks in a swarm service.**

The below command is an example of how to create the shared volume within the docker swarm:
```
docker volume create -d "cloudstor:aws" --opt backing=shared dicebox
```

Classification Service API
===========

Default URL for API: `http(s)://{hostname}:5000/`


### Anonymous End-Points


* **Get Service API Version**

For verification of service API version.

```
    [GET] /api/version
```

Result:
`
{
    "version": "String"
}
`

* **Get Service Health**
 
For use in load balanced environments.

```
    [GET] /health/plain
```
Result:
`true` or `false` with a `201` status code.


### Authentication Required End-Points


**Request Header**

The below end-points require several headers to be present on the request.

```
    'Content-type': 'application/json',
    'API-ACCESS-KEY': 'String',
    'API-VERSION': 'String'
```

* API-ACCESS-KEY: 'A unique (secret) guid used for authorization'
* API-VERSION: 'Version of the API to use'

* **Classification**

Used to classify the image data.  Return the label index for the classification.


```
    [POST] /api/classify
```
Post Body: `{ "data": "Base64 encoded PNG image" }`

Result: `{ "classification": integer }`


Example
```
    {
        "classification": 7
    }

```
* **Get Categories**

 Used to turn classification results into human-readable labels.

```
    [GET] /api/categories
```
Result: A list of label to index mappings.

Example

```
    {
        "category_map": {
            "0": "1d4_1",
            "1": "1d4_2",
            "2": "1d4_3",
            "3": "1d4_4",
            "4": "1d6_1",
            "5": "1d6_2",
            "6": "1d6_3",
            "7": "1d6_4",
            "8": "1d6_5",
            "9": "1d6_6",
            "10": "unknown"
        }
    }
```
